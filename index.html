                                                <p>One thing both words have in common is that they share an 'E'.There may be an 'I' in marriage, but it should be changed to a 'Oui'. I'll be there for you, you'll be there for me.</p>
                                                <p>Our memory bank will be as big as the Louvre, love as strong as the 'Tour d'Eiffel'. You picked me up as soon as I fell.</p>
                                                <p>So in a city of love we stand strong. Together. We can hug together, laugh together and make together... A love forever.</p>

                                        <p>When a man shows you who he is, believe him. Don't be flattered by the words he sings. For time is the ultimate torchlight. It will expose everything.</p>
                                        <p>Hold your valour and virtue tight. Don't let him compromise your morals and standards, just for what he would like. Leave him alone, let him hang dry. He has no right to ask you why.</p>
                                        <p>Confrontation, sometimes is necessary. Being firm is better than being a fairy. If it isn't yes, automatically, it's no. Don't think too much, just live in the mo...</p>
                                        <p> But in earnest, an overarching plan succeeds. Because a man has to sow in order to reap. Sometimes we just want different things, but shouting inside a cave does not make the wall sing!</p>

                                        <p>A shade that doesn't fade and brings some light into the darkness. With homes that are bigger than all of the biggest houses. A shade that is painted and coloured on kindness, could never be a thing to be ashamed of regardless</p>
                                        <p>Of the struggles that we lived with, joy is what we live for. That currency will make some of the richest men from the desparately poor. That's what keeps you going late on a night shift. Oppression is like a friend it's not someone we can lie with. But it's someone we see often, it's something that made us stronger, heartfelt and true. And if us is me and you, I hope you approve.</p>
                                        <p>In his likeness, we're made whole. Skin smooth like silver, but shines like gold. And we have been fighting for the whole time. They want oil and diamonds but freedom is the gold mine.</p>
                                        <p>Don't you see this was worth the fight and struggle, so we could be pieces to this beautiful puzzle. Our history is strong, but it made us who we are. I don't know about you but I love my battle scars.</p>
